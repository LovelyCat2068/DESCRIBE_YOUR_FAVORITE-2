    <p>I read alot of books in free time. Eg: Harry Potter Series, Tom Gates, etc. I love reading books as these are very interesting and knowledgeble. After my classes and homework I read books and merrily end the day! Reading books keeps me always happy and busy. Specially, The Harry Potter Series, Where I am reading the 4th book, Harry Potter and The Goblet of Fire! I have read the previour books which are, 1)Harry Potter and The Philosphers/Sorcerers Stone, 2)Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets and 3)Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Akzaban! I am looking forward to read the whole series. The Story is very interesting where the main character Harry Potter Saves the day with his friends, Ronald Weasley and Heromine Granger. The Tom Gates Series, is a story of a boy, who is in 5th grade. He is in a band called Dogzombies with his school friend and neighbour Derk Fingle and Norman Watson. He faces many difficult and akward situations but always enjoys in the end. In both the book series both the characters have enimies, in the Harry Potter Series, there are 2 enemies, the 1st is Lord Voldemort, a man who is much grown up than Harry, He always trys to kill Harry but he gets defeated by him and the 2nd is Draco Malfoy, a student too like Harry at Hogwarts School of Wicthcraft and Wizardry and is his enemy and hates him. While in the Tom Gates Series, the enemy is also a 5th grader, Marcus Meldrew, who is his classmate!</p>
